Enums in Rust are a custom data type that allows you to define a fixed set of distinct values, known as variants. Each variant can have its own associated data or none at all. Enums are particularly useful when you want to represent a value that can take on multiple states or options. They are commonly used for error handling, status representation, and creating custom data structures. With pattern matching, 
you can easily handle each variant differently, making enums a powerful and expressive feature in Rust.
